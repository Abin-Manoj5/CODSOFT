      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am currently in my final year of the Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) program at Krupandhi Degree College, Bangalore, where I have been building a strong foundation in computer science and programming concepts. Alongside my degree, I am also pursuing a Python Full Stack Development course at ENTRI, which is helping me gain practical skills in both frontend and backend technologies for creating complete web applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        Along with my studies, I am learning to create responsive websites and interactive applications, with a focus on performance, usability, and clean design. I always aim to improve my skills and build projects that add real value.
